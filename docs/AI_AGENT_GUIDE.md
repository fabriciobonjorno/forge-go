# AI agent guide

Forge exposes a versioned CLI catalog and read-only inspection so coding agents
can understand a project before proposing changes. Its provider-neutral
`agent` package can execute application-registered actions through policy,
validation, principal permissions, explicit approval for destructive/external
actions, and a mandatory journal. Forge does not call an LLM or provide an
autonomous action catalog; the application owns those integrations.

## Discover before acting

```sh
forge help --json
forge inspect --json
forge doctor --json
```

Use the catalog's `side_effects`, `environment`, `flags`, and `exit_codes` fields
before selecting a command. `inspect` inventories source and configuration
without executing application code or modifying project files. JSON reports
are versioned; agents should reject unknown schema versions rather than assume
that fields have unchanged meaning.

## Preview and request approval

Generators that support `--dry-run` show planned paths without writing files:

```sh
forge generate migration create_orders --dry-run
forge generate view orders --dry-run
```

Review the proposed paths and content with the user before invoking a
write-producing generator. `--dry-run` is a preview, not an authorization
token. Commands such as `forge new`, `forge migrate`, and `forge rollback`
perform filesystem, subprocess, or database effects; get explicit approval
from the user before running them. In particular, rollback may destroy data.

For application-defined agent actions, route execution through `agent.Engine`.
Register only the use cases the application intends to expose and validate
their input strictly. `Engine.Execute` accepts no principal argument: it reads
the principal established by Forge authentication middleware and rejects a
missing principal or tenant-context mismatch. It requires that principal's
exact permission for every action, then calls the configured approval adapter
for `EffectDestructive` and `EffectExternal`. It refuses to run if the policy,
validator, permission check, approval, or journal fails.
Policy and approval are application-supplied integrations: the framework
enforces that they are called, but cannot prove that a custom policy is
restrictive or that an approval represents a human grant. Configure them to
deny by default and bind approvals to the authenticated actor, tenant, action,
and intent ID.
`agent/postgres` is currently the durable journal adapter; its schema must be
applied before use, and all records are tenant-scoped with PostgreSQL RLS.
The journal adapter also requires the authenticated principal and checks that
attempt/finalization actor IDs match it; direct journal calls do not accept a
caller-invented actor.
MySQL, MariaDB, and SQLite do not yet have a first-party agent journal.

To find executions requiring operator review, grant the current principal the
exact `agent:reconcile` permission and call
`Journal.ListReconciliationCandidates(ctx, cursor, limit)`. The query returns
at most 100 metadata-only rows per page, scoped to the authenticated tenant;
both reserved rows (an attempt recorded before the callback is invoked) and
explicitly unresolved rows are included. This API only lists candidates. It
does not decide whether a remote side effect happened or mark the execution
resolved; the application must reconcile with the affected system before any
manual retry. A reserved row may still be actively executing and is never
eligible for operator resolution through this API. If a process crashes while
an execution remains `reserved`, the framework exposes it for investigation
but does not automatically declare it abandoned; applications need a worker
liveness/fencing policy before safely recovering that case. Once the executor
reports an uncertain result, an operator who has independently verified the
external effect can call
`Journal.ResolveReconciliation(ctx, executionID, result)` for an `unresolved`
row. That writes a single tenant-scoped decision
(`effect_applied` or `effect_not_applied`) with the operator identity and
timestamp, without changing the original execution record or automatically
retrying it. Pages reflect live state rather than a point-in-time snapshot; if
an execution is resolved while paging, it can disappear from later pages.

The journal persists execution/intent/actor/tenant IDs, action name, effect,
status, and a safe failure code—not prompts, inputs, outputs, or input hashes.
It is a lifecycle journal, not a complete authorization-proof ledger; it does
not independently capture policy versions, permission snapshots, or approval
grant identities.
The intent UUID is an idempotency key: a rejected or previously executed
intent cannot be replayed with modified input. If an executor returns an error,
output validation fails after execution, or final audit is uncertain, the
journal records `unresolved` where possible and the engine returns a stable
error with an execution ID and `MayHaveExecuted`; reconcile it instead of
blindly retrying. Failures before the executor starts are recorded as
failed/denied, not unresolved.

For automation, prefix the command with `--error-format=json` to receive a
versioned, secret-safe failure object on stderr:

```sh
forge --error-format=json version extra
```

The envelope uses `schema_version: 1`; its `error.code` is stable, while
underlying error details and argument values are deliberately omitted. The
process exit status remains authoritative. `doctor --json` and `inspect --json`
return their command-specific reports on stdout.

## Security boundaries

- Never pass secrets as command-line arguments or include them in generated
  source, prompts, or reports. Doctor and inspect intentionally redact
  configuration values.
- The CLI is not an authorization system. It cannot determine whether a human
  approved a CLI command. The action engine protects only calls routed through
  its registered pipeline; applications can bypass it by invoking their own
  use cases directly. The engine is
  `Intent -> Policy -> Validation -> Authorization -> Execution -> Audit`.
- PostgreSQL has a built-in transaction-scoped RLS helper. MySQL, MariaDB, and
  SQLite tenant isolation remains an application/repository responsibility;
  do not infer equivalent database enforcement from a configured adapter.
- Generated applications use Docker-oriented assets by default, but container
  generation does not replace review of secrets, database privileges, network
  exposure, or production configuration.
