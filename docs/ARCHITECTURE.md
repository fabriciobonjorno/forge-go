# Architecture

This document describes the Forge framework foundations and the layout it
prescribes for generated applications. Planned work is
labelled as such; see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Principles

- **Standard library core.** Core packages depend only on the Go standard
  library and each other ([ADR 0006](adr/0006-zero-dependency-core.md)).
  HTTP is plain `net/http` ([ADR 0002](adr/0002-stdlib-net-http-core.md)).
  Third-party dependencies (database drivers) are confined to adapter
  packages ([ADR 0007](adr/0007-postgresql-adapter-with-pgx.md),
  [ADR 0009](adr/0009-multiple-databases.md)).
- **SQL-first persistence.** Explicit SQL for the chosen database
  (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, or SQLite), no ORM ([DATABASE.md](DATABASE.md)).
- **Secure by default.** Timeouts, size limits, security headers, production
  transport requirements, and database TLS in production are on without
  configuration.
- **Fail fast.** Invalid configuration stops the process at startup
  ([ADR 0005](adr/0005-environment-configuration-fail-fast.md)); an
  unreachable database stops `Configure`.
- **Production container from day one** ([ADR 0003](adr/0003-docker-by-default.md)).
- **No speculative scaffolding.** Directories and abstractions appear when
  there is code to put in them ([ADR 0004](adr/0004-hexagonal-application-layout.md)).

Dependency direction (imports within the module):

| Package                 | Imports |
| ----------------------- | ------- |
| `forge`                 | `config`, `health`, `httpserver`, `router`, `web` |
| `auth`                  | `fault`, `tenancy`, `uuid`, `web` |
| `tenancy`               | `fault`, `uuid` |
| `httpserver`            | `config`, `fault`, `uuid`, `web` |
| `router`                | `fault`, `web` |
| `pagination`            | `fault`, `uuid` |
| `events`                | `uuid` |
| `web`                   | `fault` |
| `sqldb`                 | `config`, `fault` |
| `migrate`               | `forge`, `config` |
| `dbtest`                | `config`, `migrate`, `uuid` |
| `config`, `fault`, `health`, `uuid` | standard library only |
| `postgres`              | `forge`, `config`, `migrate`, `sqldb`, `tenancy`, pgx v5 |
| `outbox/postgres`       | `events`, `postgres` |
| `mysql`                 | `forge`, `config`, `migrate`, `sqldb`, go-sql-driver/mysql |
| `sqlite`                | `forge`, `config`, `migrate`, `sqldb`, modernc.org/sqlite |
| `postgrestest`, `mysqltest`, `sqlitetest` | their adapter, `config`, `dbtest`, `migrate` (and `sqldb` or pgx) |

Adapters depend on the core; the core never imports an adapter. The core
declares the extension points (`forge.Command`, `App.OnShutdown`,
`App.Readiness`). `architecture_test.go` runs `go list -deps` on every core
package and fails if any dependency is outside the standard library and the
core. An application builds and links only the adapter it imports, so a
SQLite application does not link pgx or the MySQL driver.

### config

`config.Load()` starts from `config.Default()`, overlays `FORGE_*`
environment variables, and calls `Validate()`. Validation rejects unknown
environments and transports, `production` with `plain` transport, `tls`
without certificate and key files, an empty address, non-positive HTTP
timeouts or size limits, database pool settings out of range, a database
statement timeout below `1ms`, and a database URL with an unknown scheme or a
malformed `postgres://`, `mysql://`, or `sqlite:` form. In `production`, a
PostgreSQL URL must carry `sslmode=require|verify-ca|verify-full` and a MySQL
URL `tls=true`, unless `FORGE_DATABASE_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT=true`.
`Database.Adapter()` reports the adapter the scheme selects, and
`Database.SQLitePath()` the SQLite file. Malformed durations, integers, and
booleans are reported by variable name without echoing the value, and URL
parse errors are not wrapped because they quote the URL.

`config.Secret` holds `FORGE_DATABASE_URL`. It prints `[REDACTED]` through
`fmt` (`String`, `GoString`), `log/slog` (`LogValue`), and text/JSON
marshaling (`MarshalText`); `Reveal()` returns the value. The full variable
list is in [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md#environment-variables).

### router

- Patterns must be `METHOD /path` using Go 1.22 `ServeMux` syntax
  (`GET /users/{id}`). Methods must be uppercase.
- Registration rejects relative paths, backslashes, and `.`/`..` segments.
  Conflicting patterns return an error instead of panicking.
- The router freezes on the first served request (an atomic flag, written
  only once); later registration returns `router.ErrFrozen`.
- At request time, paths containing encoded slashes (`%2F`), encoded
  backslashes (`%5C`), literal backslashes, or `.`/`..` segments receive a
  JSON `400` (`invalid_path`) before routing.
- Requests that match no route receive a JSON `404` (`route_not_found`);
  requests whose path matches but method does not receive a JSON `405`
  (`method_not_allowed`) with the `Allow` header. `ServeMux` decides between
  the two; its own redirects to a canonical path (for example `/tree` to
  `/tree/` for a `/tree/` pattern) are passed through unchanged. As a result,
  matched requests are looked up in the mux twice.
- `Routes()` returns the registered routes sorted by path and method.

### httpserver

Wraps the router in a fixed security/lifecycle chain, outermost first:

1. **Security headers** - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`,
   `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`,
   `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'`, and
   `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` when the
   transport is `tls` or `trusted-proxy`. The CSP targets JSON APIs; serving
   HTML requires overriding it in the handler.
2. **Request ID** - generates a UUIDv7, sets `X-Request-ID` on the response,
   and stores the ID and a logger carrying `request_id` in the request
   context (`web.RequestID`, `web.Logger`). Incoming `X-Request-ID` headers
   are not trusted or reused. If ID generation fails, the request is answered
   with a JSON `500`.
3. **Panic recovery** - logs method, path, panic value, and stack with the
   request logger; responds `500` with the JSON error body
   (`internal_error`). `http.ErrAbortHandler` is re-panicked.
4. **Body limit** - rejects a declared `Content-Length` above
   `FORGE_HTTP_MAX_BODY_BYTES` with a JSON `413` (`body_too_large`), and wraps
   the body in `http.MaxBytesReader` for undeclared or chunked bodies.
5. **Application middleware** - zero or more optional handlers registered
   with `forge.WithHTTPMiddleware`. They run in declaration order, outermost
   first among custom middleware, after the body limit and inside panic
   recovery. They receive the framework request ID and may add request-scoped
   context for tracing, metrics, or application-specific behavior.
6. **Router.**

Because security headers and the request ID come first, every response,
including `413`, recovered panics, and router errors, carries them. Every
error the framework itself produces uses the JSON error format.

The `http.Server` is configured with `ReadHeaderTimeout`, `ReadTimeout`,
`WriteTimeout`, `IdleTimeout`, and `MaxHeaderBytes` from configuration. In
`tls` mode it calls `ListenAndServeTLS` with the configured files; otherwise
it serves plain HTTP. `Run(ctx)` blocks until the context is cancelled, then
calls `Shutdown` bounded by `FORGE_HTTP_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT`. If requests are
still running at that deadline, it closes all connections, which cancels
those requests' contexts so they release resources such as database
connections.

`trusted-proxy` mode means "TLS is terminated upstream". It enables HSTS and
satisfies the production transport rule. It does not rewrite the client
address or scheme from `X-Forwarded-*` headers.

### web

The HTTP adapter toolkit for handlers:

- `web.JSON(w, status, value)` writes a JSON response.
- `web.Error(w, r, err)` writes the only error format Forge produces:

  ```json
  {"error":{"code":"task_not_found","message":"task not found","request_id":"01..."}}
  ```

  Only the `Code` and `Message` of the first `*fault.Error` in the chain
  reach the client, with the status from `fault.Error.Status()`. Any other
  error becomes `500 internal_error`. Responses with status `500` or above
  are logged at error level through the request logger, with the error and,
  for a fault, its cause (`cause` attribute). When the client has gone away
  (the request context is done and the error is `context.Canceled`), the
  failure is logged at debug level instead. Causes and metadata are never
  serialized.
- `web.DecodeJSON(r, dst)` decodes strictly: the content type must be
  `application/json` (`415 unsupported_media_type` otherwise); unknown
  fields, invalid JSON, wrong types, an empty body, and any data after the
  first value (including a stray `}` or `]`) are `400 invalid_json`; an
  oversized body is `413 body_too_large`; any other read failure is
  `400 unreadable_body` with a generic message. Errors are faults, so they can
  be passed to `web.Error`.
- `web.RequestID(ctx)` and `web.Logger(ctx)` return the request ID and the
  request-scoped `*slog.Logger` (never nil; a discarding logger outside a
  request).

### pagination

Keyset pagination over UUIDv7 primary keys: `WHERE id < $cursor ORDER BY id
DESC LIMIT $n`. `FromQuery` reads `cursor` and `limit` (default `50`, maximum
`200`) and returns `400` faults for invalid values. The cursor is the
base64url (unpadded) encoding of the last UUID; `DecodeCursor` accepts only
the canonical encoding of a UUIDv7 (it re-encodes and compares, because Go's
base64 decoder skips `\r` and `\n` even in strict mode), so each ID has
exactly one valid cursor. Both malleability cases were found by
`FuzzDecodeCursor` and are kept as seeds in `pagination/testdata`. `NewPage(rows, limit, id)` takes up to `limit+1` rows and
uses the extra row only to decide whether to emit `next_cursor`.
`Page[T]` serializes as `{"items":[...],"next_cursor":"..."}`. See
[DATABASE.md](DATABASE.md#repositories-and-dbtx).

### health

`health.Registry` holds named `Check func(context.Context) error` functions.
`Ready` runs them sequentially in name order with the request context and
reports each check's name and pass/fail; error text is not exposed.

| Route               | Behaviour |
| ------------------- | --------- |
| `GET /health/live`  | Always `200 {"status":"live"}` while the process serves HTTP |
| `GET /health/ready` | `200` if all checks pass, else `503`; body `{"healthy":..,"checks":[{"name":..,"healthy":..}]}` |
| `GET /health`       | Same as `/health/ready` |

Each check runs with its own timeout, `health.DefaultCheckTimeout` (2
seconds) for the registry `forge.App` uses (`health.NewWithTimeout` sets
another value on a standalone registry); a check must honour its context.
Checks run one after another, so the endpoint can take up to the number of
checks times the timeout. Generated applications register `database` (a pool
ping).

### uuid

`uuid.UUID` is a 16-byte RFC 9562 UUIDv7. The package-level generator uses
`crypto/rand` and is monotonic within a process: within the same millisecond,
or if the clock moves backwards, it increments the random field instead of
reseeding. `Parse` accepts only version 7, RFC variant values in canonical
36-character form. `UUID` implements `encoding.TextMarshaler`,
`json.Marshaler`, `driver.Valuer` (string), and `sql.Scanner` (string, text
bytes, or 16 raw bytes of a UUIDv7). See
[ADR 0001](adr/0001-uuidv7-default-identifier.md).

### fault

`fault.Error` carries a stable `Code`, a client-safe `Message`, a `Category`
(`invalid`, `unauthorized`, `forbidden`, `not_found`, `conflict`,
`unavailable`, `internal`), an optional `Cause`, `Metadata`, `Retryable`, and
`HTTPStatus`.

- `Error()` returns `code: message` and never includes the cause; `Unwrap`
  exposes the cause to `errors.Is`/`errors.As`.
- `Is` matches another `*fault.Error` with the same `Code`, so a sentinel is
  recognized after `WithCause` copies it.
- `Status()` returns `HTTPStatus` when set, otherwise the category default:
  `400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `409`, `503`, and `500` for `internal` or an
  unknown category.
- `fault.From(err)` returns the first `*fault.Error` in the chain, or nil.

### Database packages

See [DATABASE.md](DATABASE.md) for usage.

**`sqldb`** (core). `Kind` is a database-independent failure category
(not found, unique, foreign key, exclusion, invalid data, conflict, timeout,
unavailable); each adapter's classifier maps driver errors to a
`Classification{Kind, Constraint}`, and `sqldb.Translate` maps kinds to
faults, so every database yields the same public codes. `Retry` reruns a
transaction on conflicts with exponential backoff; `CloseWithin` bounds a
pool close by a context. `sqldb.DB` wraps `*sql.DB` with the configured pool
limits and provides `DBTX` (sqlc's `database/sql` interface), `InTx`,
`InTxWith`, `Translate`, `Ping`, `Close`, `Shutdown`, and `SQL()`.

**`migrate`** (core). `LoadMigrations` reads and validates the SQL files;
`New(db, dialect, migrations, logger)` returns a `Migrator` that owns its
`*sql.DB` and never reuses sessions; `Up`, `Down`, `Status`, and `Close` run
it. A `Dialect` supplies placeholders, session preparation, a non-blocking
lock, and table lookup. `Commands(fs, opener)` builds the `migrate` and
`rollback` subcommands. The bookkeeping table uses portable types
([ADR 0008](adr/0008-sql-migrations-embedded-in-the-binary.md)).

**`dbtest`** (core). `ServerURL` finds the test server
(`FORGE_TEST_<ADAPTER>_URL`, else `FORGE_TEST_DATABASE_URL` when its scheme
matches) and skips or, with `FORGE_TEST_REQUIRE_DATABASE=true`, fails the
test without one; `DatabaseName` and `Migrate` are shared helpers.

**Adapters.** Each has `Open`, `Translate`, `NewMigrator(cfg, migrations,
logger)`, `Commands(fs)`, and a test package with `New`, `NewMigrated`,
`Config`, and `NewWithConfig`. Each refuses a URL that selects another
adapter.

- `postgres` keeps pgx natively: `Open` returns `*postgres.DB` (a `pgxpool`
  pool with `statement_timeout`, a default `application_name` of `forge`,
  and `timestamptz` scanned as UTC) with its own `DBTX`, `InTx`/`InTxWith`,
  `SQLState`, `ConstraintName`, advisory lock helpers, `Shutdown`, and
  `Pool()`. Its migrator uses a dedicated connection through pgx's `stdlib`.
- `mysql` serves MySQL and MariaDB and returns `*sqldb.DB`. It builds the
  driver configuration field by field, accepts only the `tls` URL parameter,
  and configures every connection (utf8mb4, UTC, strict `sql_mode`, a
  flavor-specific statement timeout). Multi-statement execution is enabled
  only on the migrator's pool; the migration lock is `GET_LOCK`.
- `sqlite` uses the pure-Go modernc.org/sqlite driver (so `CGO_ENABLED=0`
  holds) and returns `*sqldb.DB`. It enforces foreign keys, WAL,
  `busy_timeout`, immediate transactions, defensive mode, and no
  double-quoted strings on every connection; the migration lock is an
  operating-system lock on a sidecar file.

### forge (application runtime)

`forge.New(opts...)` builds an `App` from a validated `config.Config`
(`WithConfig`) and an `*slog.Logger` (`WithLogger`), registers the health
routes, and constructs the HTTP server. `App` exposes `Config`, `Logger`,
`Handle`, `HandleFunc`, `Readiness`, `Routes`, `Handler`, `OnShutdown`,
`Close`, and `Run`.

- `OnShutdown(hook)` registers a `func(ctx) error` that releases a resource.
  Hooks run once, in reverse registration order.
- `Run(ctx)` serves until `ctx` is cancelled, drains in-flight requests,
  then runs the hooks. Draining and hooks share one budget,
  `FORGE_HTTP_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT`, counted from the cancellation: the hooks'
  context expires at cancellation time plus that timeout, so time spent
  draining is not available to the hooks.
- `Close(ctx)` runs the hooks; use it directly only for an `App` that is
  never run (for example in tests).

`forge.Main(configure, commands...)` is the conventional entrypoint, where
`type Configure func(ctx context.Context, app *forge.App) error` and `ctx` is
cancelled on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`:

1. Validates the extra commands: each needs a name and a `Run` function,
   names must be unique, and `serve`, `healthcheck`, and `help` are reserved.
   A violation exits with code `2`.
2. Parses the subcommand (default `serve`). `help`, `-h`, and `--help` list
   the commands and exit `0`. Unknown commands, or arguments to `serve` or
   `healthcheck`, exit `2`.
3. Loads configuration from the environment; invalid configuration is
   reported on stderr and exits `1`.
4. Creates a logger on stdout: JSON in `staging`/`production`, text in
   `development`/`test`.
5. `serve`: builds the `App` and calls `configure`. If `configure` fails, the
   shutdown hooks registered so far run and the process exits `1`. Otherwise
   it runs the server until the signal, then shuts down as above. Exit code
   `1` if building, configuring, serving, or shutdown fails.
6. `healthcheck`: sends `GET /health/live` to `127.0.0.1` on the port from
   `FORGE_HTTP_ADDR` with a 2-second timeout and exits `0` only on `200`. In
   `tls` mode it uses HTTPS and skips certificate verification, because the
   certificate is issued for the public hostname, not the loopback address.
   The probe sends no credentials. It exists because distroless images have
   no shell or `curl`.
7. Extra commands: `forge.Command{Name, Summary, Run}`. `Run(ctx, env, args)`
   receives the remaining arguments and a `CommandEnv` with the loaded
   configuration, the logger, stdout, and stderr. An error is printed as
   `<name>: <error>` and exits `2` if it wraps `forge.ErrUsage` (invalid
   arguments), otherwise `1`. The adapters' `Commands` (built on
   `migrate.Commands`) contribute `migrate` and `rollback` this way and
   report argument errors with `forge.ErrUsage`.

`forge.Execute(ctx, args, lookup, stdout, stderr, configure, commands...) int`
is the same flow with injectable arguments, environment lookup, and output
streams, for tests.

### CLI

`internal/cli` implements the `forge` command (see the
[README](../README.md#cli)). It runs `go` and the application binary directly
through `os/exec`, never through a shell. `forge dev`, `forge migrate`, and
`forge rollback` build `cmd/<name>` into a temporary directory and run the
binary, so migrations in development go through the same code path as in
production. `forge dev`, `forge test`, `forge migrate`, `forge rollback`, and
`forge doctor` load `.env.development` and `.env.local`, with the process
environment taking precedence.

## Generated application layout

`forge new` creates only what the application needs to run:

```text
cmd/<name>/main.go   forge.Main(bootstrap.Configure, <adapter>.Commands(db.Migrations())...)
app/bootstrap/       composition root: database pool, readiness check "database", routes
                     (generated with GET /v1/status and tests)
db/db.go             embeds db/migrations
db/migrations/       SQL migrations (empty, with .keep)
```

`--database` chooses the adapter (default `postgresql`); `--database none`
(or `--skip-database`) omits `db/` and the database wiring. Per-database
settings (Compose image and service, CI service, development and test URLs,
production TLS rule, migration lock description) are profiles in
`internal/scaffold/database.go`. Templates live in
`internal/scaffold/templates` and are embedded in the CLI binary. Generated Go
files are passed through `gofmt`.

As the application grows, code is placed in hexagonal layers
([ADR 0004](adr/0004-hexagonal-application-layout.md)):

| Directory            | Contents                                                        | May import |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| `app/domain`         | Entities, value objects, domain rules and errors                | standard library, `uuid`, `fault` |
| `app/application`    | Use cases and the ports (interfaces) they need                  | `domain`; framework value packages (`uuid`, `fault`, `pagination`) |
| `app/adapters`       | HTTP handlers, repository implementations, other port adapters  | `application`, `domain`, framework |
| `app/infrastructure` | Technical resources: connection pools, clients, telemetry setup | framework, drivers |
| `app/bootstrap`      | Composition root that wires everything into `forge.App`         | everything |

These directories are not generated as empty scaffolding; the layer rules
are conventions and are not enforced by a check. Generated applications open
the database pool directly in `app/bootstrap`.
[`examples/basic-api`](../examples/basic-api) shows the layout with
`app/domain`, `app/application`, `app/adapters/persistence`,
`app/adapters/httpapi`, and `app/bootstrap`.
