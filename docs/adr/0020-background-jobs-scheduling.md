# ADR 0020: Background jobs and scheduling

Status: accepted (Phase 4)

## Context

Phase 4 established the transactional outbox and a concurrent dispatcher for
event delivery. The remaining scope is background jobs (recurring work that
produces domain events) and scheduling (when work should run). Both must work
across process replicas without holding database locks during external I/O.

## Decision

- Introduce a `jobs` package that defines a `Job` interface: a function that
  receives a context and returns an error. Jobs run in their own goroutine
  with a configurable concurrency bound.
- Jobs may enqueue outbox events via `outbox/postgres.Insert` using a
  transaction from `postgres.InTx`. This makes the event persistence atomic
  with any domain state change the job performs.
- Scheduling is a separate concern. The scheduler accepts a cron-like
  specification and a `Job` factory. It runs in-process and is not a
  distributed scheduler — each replica runs its own scheduler instance.
- To avoid duplicate job execution across replicas, jobs that must run
  exactly once per schedule tick should use a PostgreSQL advisory lock
  (`postgres.TryAdvisoryXactLock`) around their work. The scheduler does not
  enforce this; it is a job-level decision.
- The scheduler supports fixed-rate (every N seconds/minutes/hours), daily
  at a specific UTC time, and numeric 5-field cron expressions with lists,
  ascending ranges, and steps. Day-of-month and day-of-week use cron's OR
  matching rule when both are restricted. Sunday accepts both 0 and 7.
- A single semaphore enforces `MaxConcurrentJobs` across all registered jobs.
  Failures are sent to an injected error callback (or the default structured
  logger), and registrations are frozen after `Start`.
- Job execution observes the application shutdown context; in-flight jobs
  receive a cancellation signal and must honor it promptly.
- No persistence of job history or results in this phase. Observability is
  via structured logs and the outbox queue metrics (`Dispatcher.Stats`).
- Generated applications with a supported database expose a bootstrap helper
  that starts the scheduler and stops it during application shutdown. The
  `forge generate job` command creates a handler/test pair; registration and
  schedule remain explicit in the composition root.

## Consequences

- Each replica runs its own scheduler; job authors must use advisory locks
  or idempotent outbox events for exactly-once semantics.
- Scheduler precision depends on the process being alive; no catch-up for
  missed ticks while the process was down. Cron month/day names, macros,
  time zones other than UTC, and seconds fields are not supported.
- Outbox metrics (`Dispatcher.Stats`) serve as the primary visibility into
  job-produced event throughput.
- The scheduler is in-process and does not require a separate service or
  database table.
