# ADR 0018: PostgreSQL outbox dispatch

Status: accepted

## Context

The transactional outbox foundation made event persistence atomic with domain
writes but did not define delivery. Dispatch must work across process replicas
without holding database locks during external I/O, and must make duplicate
delivery and poison events explicit.

## Decision

- Claim one eligible row at a time using PostgreSQL `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`
  and an atomic update. The database transaction ends before the handler runs.
- Bound in-process worker concurrency, use database-clock lease timestamps,
  renew active leases, and fence acknowledgement/retry by a per-claim UUID
  token. A stale worker cannot mutate a row after it has been reclaimed.
- Deliver with at-least-once semantics. A process can fail after a handler's
  external side effect but before acknowledgement; consumers must be
  idempotent. Exactly-once external effects are not promised.
- Retry handler failures using capped exponential full jitter. After the
  configured maximum attempts, retain the event in a terminal dead-letter
  state; do not delete it or persist arbitrary handler error text, which may
  contain sensitive data.
- Treat this as a trusted global worker: the outbox is not tenant-scoped.
  Applications handling tenant data must include the necessary tenant
  identity in their application-owned payload and enforce authorization in
  the handler. Payloads must not contain secrets or unnecessary personal data.
- Keep the migrations irreversible to protect durable event records. Manual
  dead-letter replay and queue observability are follow-up work.

## Consequences

- Multiple workers and replicas can claim different events without a global
  advisory lock.
- A handler slower than the initial lease can continue safely while its lease
  renews, provided it honors the application context. If the database becomes
  unavailable long enough to lose the lease, delivery can repeat.
- Terminal rows require operator visibility and an explicit replay policy;
  consumers must not assume the framework automatically retries them.
- The global-worker trust boundary is unsuitable for applications whose
  database policy requires tenant-isolated worker access without additional
  application-owned enforcement.
