# Multi-tenancy

Forge tenancy is fail-closed. `tenancy.WithContext` accepts only a UUIDv7
tenant and `tenancy.Require` returns `tenant_required` when no tenant was
resolved. There is no process-wide, environment, or default tenant fallback.

The authentication middleware installs the tenant returned by the current
session resolver. Applications must never resolve a tenant from an unsigned
client header.

## PostgreSQL row-level security

`postgres.DB.InTenantTx` and `InTenantTxWith` require a tenant in the context
before acquiring a connection. On every transaction attempt they execute:

```sql
SELECT set_config('forge.tenant_id', $1, true);
```

The third argument makes the setting transaction-local, so it is cleared at
commit/rollback and cannot leak through the connection pool. Serialization
retries reinstall it before application SQL runs.

Tables opt into RLS explicitly in reviewed migrations:

```sql
ALTER TABLE tasks ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE tasks FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY tasks_tenant_isolation ON tasks
USING (tenant_id::text = current_setting('forge.tenant_id', true))
WITH CHECK (tenant_id::text = current_setting('forge.tenant_id', true));
```

The serving database role must not be a superuser or have `BYPASSRLS`, because
those roles bypass policies. Migration roles commonly own tables and should be
separate from the less-privileged serving role. Repository methods for
tenant-owned data run inside `InTenantTx`; direct pool queries do not receive a
tenant setting and RLS denies them when policies are written fail-closed.

The PostgreSQL integration test creates a non-superuser role and proves that
two tenant contexts see only their rows, cross-tenant inserts fail, a missing
tenant fails before a transaction, and the setting does not remain in the
pool.

## MySQL, MariaDB, and SQLite

These adapters have no equivalent database-level RLS guarantee in Forge.
Repositories must include `tenant_id` in every key and predicate and accept a
tenant explicitly or call `tenancy.Require(ctx)`. This application-layer rule
is weaker than PostgreSQL RLS; the framework does not claim otherwise. A
future adapter API may make scoped repositories easier, but it must not imply
database enforcement that the database does not provide.
