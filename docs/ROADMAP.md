## Phase 0 - Architecture

Architecture overview, deployment guide, threat model, security policy, and
ADRs 0001-0006.

## Phase 1 - Core runtime (done)

- `config`: environment loading, defaults, fail-fast validation, production
  transport rule.
- `router`: `ServeMux` patterns, freeze on first request, traversal and
  encoded-slash rejection.
- `httpserver`: timeouts, body limit, security headers, HSTS, `X-Request-ID`,
  panic recovery, graceful shutdown.
- `health`: readiness registry and `/health`, `/health/live`, `/health/ready`.
- `uuid`: monotonic RFC 9562 UUIDv7 with JSON, text, and SQL support.
- `fault`: typed application errors.
- `forge.Main` / `forge.Execute`: conventional entrypoint with `serve` and
  `healthcheck` subcommands, environment-dependent log format, signal
  handling.
- CLI: `new`, `dev`, `build`, `version`, `uuid`, `doctor`.
- `forge new`: application skeleton with Dockerfile, Compose, and CI.

## Phase 2 - Databases (done)

Database:

- `config.Database` with `FORGE_DATABASE_*` variables; the URL is a
  redacted `config.Secret`; `production` requires TLS to the database unless
  explicitly allowed.
- `postgres` adapter on pgx v5 ([ADR 0007](adr/0007-postgresql-adapter-with-pgx.md)):
  pool with statement timeout and startup ping, `DBTX` compatible with sqlc,
  `InTx`/`InTxWith` with isolation levels and retries on serialization
  failures and deadlocks, error translation to `fault`, transaction-scoped
  advisory locks, and the `Pool()` escape hatch.
- SQL migrations embedded in the binary
  ([ADR 0008](adr/0008-sql-migrations-embedded-in-the-binary.md)):
  checksums, advisory lock, per-migration transactions with a
  `no-transaction` opt-out, fail-closed checks, `migrate`, `migrate status`,
  and `rollback` subcommands.
- `pagination`: UUIDv7 keyset pagination with opaque cursors.
- `postgrestest`: a fresh database per test; CI mode that fails instead of
  skipping.
- Core/adapter boundary enforced by `architecture_test.go`.
- CLI: `forge migrate [status]`, `forge rollback [-steps N]`,
  `forge generate migration NAME`, `forge test`, `.env.development` /
  `.env.local` loading, `forge doctor` showing the database target without
  credentials.
- `forge new` generates PostgreSQL by default (`--skip-database` to omit it):
  database wiring, readiness check, embedded migrations directory, Compose
  stack with PostgreSQL 18 and a one-off `migrate` service, and a CI
  PostgreSQL service.
- `examples/basic-api`: a task API showing repositories, transactions,
  optimistic locking, and pagination.
- Documentation: [DATABASE.md](DATABASE.md).

Multiple databases, completed before Phase 3
([ADR 0009](adr/0009-multiple-databases.md)):

- `forge new --database postgresql|mysql|mariadb|sqlite|none` (`-d`), with
  per-database Compose service, CI service, development settings, and
  Dockerfile (a nonroot storage volume for SQLite).
- Adapter selection by the `FORGE_DATABASE_URL` scheme (`postgres://`,
  `mysql://`, `sqlite:`), with production TLS rules for PostgreSQL and MySQL.
- Standard-library core packages shared by all adapters: `sqldb` (one error
  translation for every database, retries, bounded close, `database/sql`
  wrapper), `migrate` (the migration engine, moved out of `postgres`, with a
  `Dialect` interface and a portable bookkeeping table), and `dbtest`.
- `mysql` adapter for MySQL 8.4 and MariaDB 11.8: hardened driver
  configuration, strict session, flavor-specific statement timeout,
  `GET_LOCK` migration lock.
- `sqlite` adapter on the pure-Go modernc.org/sqlite driver: enforced
  pragmas, operating-system file lock for migrations.
- A uniform adapter surface (`Open`, `Translate`, `NewMigrator`, `Commands`,
  and `New`/`NewMigrated`/`Config`/`NewWithConfig` test helpers); readiness
  check named `database` in generated applications.
- CI: tests against PostgreSQL 18, MySQL 8.4, and MariaDB 11.8, and a Docker
  smoke test of a generated application per database.

Core changes made alongside:

- `web`: JSON responses, a single error body
  (`{"error":{"code","message","request_id"}}`), strict JSON decoding,
  request ID and request-scoped logger in the context.
- `httpserver`: request ID and logger set before panic recovery; recovered
  panics, oversized bodies, and request-ID failures answer in the JSON error
  format; requests still running at the shutdown deadline have their
  connections closed, cancelling their contexts.
- `router`: JSON `400`, `404` and `405` (with `Allow`) responses; atomic
  freeze flag.
- `fault`: category default statuses (`Status()`), `From`, and `Is` by code.
- `health`: per-check timeout (2 seconds by default).
- `forge`: `Configure` receives a context; `App.Config`, `App.Logger`,
  `App.OnShutdown`, `App.Close`; one shutdown budget shared by the HTTP drain
  and the hooks; application-defined subcommands (`forge.Command`, with
  `forge.ErrUsage` for exit status 2) and `help`.
- `forge new` adds `.github/dependabot.yml`.

## Known gaps

Not scheduled in a specific phase unless noted.

- `X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Forwarded-Proto` are not interpreted; handlers see
  the proxy's address behind `trusted-proxy`.
- Readiness results are not cached; every probe runs the checks.
- Matched requests are looked up in `ServeMux` twice (once to detect
  unmatched routes); tracked for Phase 9.
- MySQL/MariaDB/SQLite tenant isolation is enforced at the application layer;
  only PostgreSQL currently has the built-in RLS transaction helper.
- Soft delete and audit fields (`created_by`, `updated_by`, `deleted_at`)
  have no framework support yet; applications add them in their own SQL.
- Keyset pagination orders by UUIDv7 only; there is no cursor for other sort
  orders.
- `forge migrate` and `forge rollback` require a single command under
  `cmd/`.
- MySQL/MariaDB TLS verifies against the system certificate pool only; a
  private CA cannot be configured.
- SQLite applications run as a single instance on a single host.
- Application-level lock helpers exist for PostgreSQL only.

## Phase 3 - Identity and tenancy

Implemented foundation:

- opaque 256-bit bearer tokens with digest-only persistence;
- a resolver port that must load current session, subject, membership and
  permissions on every request;
- strict bearer middleware and deny-by-default `resource:action` permissions;
- fail-closed typed tenant context;
- PostgreSQL `InTenantTx` with a transaction-local RLS setting and a real
  cross-tenant integration test;
- versioned PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 password hashing using Go's standard library;
- PostgreSQL user/organization/tenant/membership/role/permission/session schema;
- a concrete PostgreSQL session repository that implements `auth.Resolver`,
  recomputes current permissions, and supports per-session and user-wide
  revocation;
- tenant-scoped email/password login with uniform authentication failures,
  dummy-hash timing equalization, password-work-factor upgrades, and thin
  login/logout HTTP adapters;
- account/source login throttling with a bounded in-memory default, HTTP 429
  plus Retry-After, and a shared PostgreSQL adapter with bounded pruning
  ([ADR 0011](adr/0011-login-throttling.md));
- explicit browser-cookie sessions with secure `__Host-` cookies, same-origin
  login protection, double-submit CSRF validation, CSRF-protected logout, and
  no-store login responses
  ([ADR 0012](adr/0012-cookie-sessions-and-csrf.md));
- structured security-audit event contract plus append-only PostgreSQL
  persistence with request-ID correlation and no arbitrary secret-bearing
  metadata ([ADR 0016](adr/0016-structured-security-audit.md));
- one-time password recovery with digest-only tokens, non-enumerating request
  responses, global session revocation on reset, and bounded cleanup
  ([ADR 0013](adr/0013-password-recovery.md));
- replay-safe TOTP MFA with encrypted seeds, short-lived digest-only challenges,
  one-time backup codes, factor rotation/disable, credential-version-bound
  session creation, and bearer/browser completion flows
  ([ADR 0014](adr/0014-totp-mfa.md), [ADR 0015](adr/0015-mfa-factor-lifecycle.md)).
- PostgreSQL identity wiring in generated applications, including migrations,
  login/logout/session routes, optional MFA challenge completion, and the
  `FORGE_AUTH_MFA_KEY` configuration.
- Generated PostgreSQL applications include bearer and secure-cookie login,
  logout and session routes, plus password-recovery request/reset routes.
  Recovery delivery deliberately fails closed until an application installs a
  `RecoverySender`; the generated placeholder must never claim delivery or log
  recovery tokens.
- Structured audit events for login, logout, password recovery/reset, MFA
  challenge and factor lifecycle operations. Audit persistence is opt-in for
  framework services; generated PostgreSQL login, MFA, and logout flows wire
  the repository as their auditor.
- Optional authentication middleware and `RequireAudited` hooks for rejected
  valid sessions and permission denials. These are opt-in because each rejected
  valid token can cause a database write; deployments should limit request
  volume and plan retention/capacity.

Remaining boundaries: generated applications do not provision the first user
or tenant; password-recovery delivery needs a configured sender; and MFA
enrollment/rotation still requires an application-specific step-up policy.
Those framework primitives require application-specific decisions and are documented in
[AUTHENTICATION.md](AUTHENTICATION.md) and [MFA.md](MFA.md). PostgreSQL is the
only built-in identity persistence adapter and the only adapter with a
database-enforced RLS helper. MySQL, MariaDB, and SQLite use the documented
application-layer tenant-scoping contract; Forge does not claim equivalent
database enforcement ([MULTI_TENANCY.md](MULTI_TENANCY.md)). Broader audit
coverage for missing/malformed credentials and infrastructure failures during
session resolution is intentionally omitted to avoid persisting unbounded
untrusted input or coupling audit availability to resolver outages.

## Phase 4 - Asynchronous work

The event envelope, atomic PostgreSQL persistence, and bounded concurrent
dispatcher with renewable leases, token-fenced acknowledgements, exponential
retry, and a terminal dead-letter state are implemented. Dead-letter replay,
queue metrics (`Dispatcher.Stats`, `ListDeadLetters`), an in-process job
scheduler (`jobs.Scheduler`), and generated-application wiring are complete.
See [ADR 0018](adr/0018-transactional-outbox-foundation.md),
[ADR 0019](adr/0019-outbox-dispatch.md), and
[ADR 0020](adr/0020-background-jobs-scheduling.md).

## Phase 5 - Observability

OpenTelemetry traces, metrics, and log correlation.

## Phase 6 - API tooling

OpenAPI description and related tooling.

## Phase 7 - AI subsystem

An API and CLI surface for AI-driven operations. Every action passes through a
fixed pipeline:

```text
Intent -> Policy -> Validation -> Authorization -> Execution -> Audit
```

No step may be skipped, and execution never runs with more privilege than the
authorizing principal.

AI-friendly developer experience checklist:

- [x] `forge help --json`: versioned command/flag schema and declared
  side-effect categories; covered by `TestRunHelpJSONProvidesCompleteCommandCatalog`.
- [x] `forge doctor --json`: schema-versioned diagnostics with stable codes
  and remediation, tested for valid/invalid configuration and secret redaction.
- [x] Extend the catalog with per-command options, copyable examples,
  environment-file/variable inputs and process/command exit codes.
- [x] `forge inspect --json`: report module, Go/framework versions, database adapter,
  migrations, routes and enabled first-party modules without executing writes.
- [x] Structured CLI errors: stable codes and safe context, with human output
  remaining the default and exit codes documented.
- [x] `forge generate migration|view NAME --dry-run`: show exact planned files
  without creating directories or files; existing outputs are refused.
- [x] Provider-neutral `agent.Engine`: only registered actions run, and each
  call passes policy, input validation, exact principal permission, execution,
  and mandatory journal steps. Destructive/external effects additionally
  require the application's explicit approval adapter.
- [x] PostgreSQL execution journal persists an attempt before effects,
  rejects tenant/actor-scoped intent replay, omits prompts and payloads, and
  protects records with RLS. Uncertain post-execution outcomes stay visible.
- [x] Bounded, tenant-scoped reconciliation listing for reserved and unresolved
  agent executions; requires the explicit `agent:reconcile` permission and
  returns metadata only. Applying a reconciliation remains application-owned.
- [x] Record one operator decision for an explicitly unresolved execution in a
  separate tenant-RLS-protected table; serialize concurrent decisions and never
  mutate the original journal row or automatically retry the action.
- [ ] Define action-specific worker-liveness/fencing for executions left
  `reserved` after process crashes. A lease expiry alone cannot prove that an
  executor or external operation stopped; current API deliberately refuses
  generic resolution or retry of these rows.
- [ ] First-party execution journals and migration wiring for MySQL, MariaDB
  and SQLite; provider runtime and generated agent actions are also not included.
- [x] Agent-oriented CLI guide: quickstart, copyable commands, machine-readable
  catalog/error references and explicit database/security limits
  ([AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md](AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md)).
- [x] CLI contract tests prove stable JSON error output, secret redaction and
  that `forge inspect --json` does not modify project files.
- [x] Agent tests prove policy/validation/permission/approval/journal ordering,
  refusal of unauthorized actions and replay, tenant isolation, and surfaced
  uncertain outcomes. The CLI remains outside this authorization boundary.

## Phase 8 - Code generation

`forge generate resource` and related generators that create hexagonal layers
(`app/domain`, `app/application`, `app/adapters`, `app/infrastructure`) only
when they have code to hold. `forge generate migration` already exists.

Generator checklist (planned unless an implementation and its tests prove
otherwise):

- [ ] `forge generate resource NAME`: coherent migration, validation,
  persistence, HTTP and tests; no empty layers or public CRUD by default.
- [ ] Explicit resource scope: `--tenant-scoped` versus `--global`, with the
  correct database-specific isolation pattern and cross-tenant tests.
- [ ] Resource-generator `--dry-run` and refuse-overwrite behavior with stable,
  reviewable output (migration/view previews are implemented separately).
- [ ] `forge generate job NAME`: bounded execution, shutdown behavior,
  retries/idempotency guidance and generated tests.
- [x] `forge generate view NAME`: embedded server-rendered Go HTML template
  with contextual escaping and buffered execution; no database write semantics.
- [ ] SQL view generators remain separate from server-rendered HTML and need
  explicit database-dialect and tenant-isolation contracts.
- [ ] Generated applications compile, vet, test and pass database/Docker
  smoke checks for every supported profile.

## Phase 9 - Performance

Benchmarks, profiling, and allocation work on hot paths (router, middleware,
UUID generation).

## Phase 10 - Security hardening

Review against the [threat model](THREAT_MODEL.md), broader fuzzing, and
supply-chain hardening (pinned base images and actions, SBOM, signed images).

## Also planned (unscheduled)

- Kamal-style deploy configuration.
- Dev container definition.
